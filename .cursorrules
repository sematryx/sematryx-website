# Sematryx Website - Cursor Rules

## Workflow Rules

### After Task Completion
**CRITICAL**: After completing a task that the user has confirmed/approved:
1. **Always commit and push** the changes immediately
2. Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed
3. Do not wait for explicit instruction to commit - this is automatic after confirmation

### Commit Message Format
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include what was changed and why (if relevant)
- Group related changes in a single commit

### Example Workflow
```
User: "Implement feature X"
[Implementation happens]
User: [confirms/accepts changes]
→ Automatically commit and push
```

## Code Standards

### TypeScript/React
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use proper type definitions
- Follow Next.js 14+ App Router conventions

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow existing design system (dark theme, consistent spacing)
- Use Lucide React icons (not emojis) for professional appearance
- Maintain responsive design (mobile-first approach)

### Components
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use proper prop types/interfaces
- Follow existing component patterns

## Navigation Standards

### Top Navigation
- Site-wide navigation (marketing/product pages)
- Should be consistent across all pages

### Side Navigation
- Documentation-specific navigation
- Should be collapsible on desktop
- Should have mobile drawer

## Documentation Standards

### Code Examples
- Use professional, production-ready examples
- Keep examples up-to-date with API changes
- Use consistent terminology (Sematryx Intelligence, not AEAO)

### Content
- Remove all AEAO branding references
- Use "3 Core Pillars: Agentic, Interpretable, Adaptive"
- Domain Extension is separate from core pillars

## Git Workflow

### Branching
- Work on master/main branch unless specified otherwise
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages

### Deployment
- Changes are automatically deployed after push (if connected to Vercel)
- No manual deployment step needed unless specified

## Important Notes

- Always use SVG icons (Lucide React) - never emojis in UI
- Maintain dark theme consistency
- Keep navigation professional and modern
- Follow modern tech product design standards
