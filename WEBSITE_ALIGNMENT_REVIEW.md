# Website Alignment Review
**Review Date**: 2025-01-11  
**Purpose**: Compare website content with builder documentation and provisional patents to ensure accurate representation

---

## Executive Summary

The website generally aligns well with the product documentation, but there are several **gaps**, **inaccuracies**, and **missing features** that need to be addressed:

### Key Findings:
- ✅ **Core Tetrad pillars**: Accurately represented
- ✅ **Configuration system**: Well documented
- ⚠️ **Advanced capabilities**: Mentioned but not prominently featured
- ❌ **Temporal Intelligence**: Missing from website (prominent in patents)
- ❌ **Knowledge Systems**: Missing from website (vector compression, knowledge graphs)
- ⚠️ **Domain count discrepancy**: Website says "13+" but docs say "6 operational"
- ⚠️ **Self-improvement status**: Website may overstate current integration status
- ⚠️ **Federated Learning**: In API docs but not in marketing content

---

## 1. Core Tetrad Pillars - Alignment Check

### ✅ Agentic Intelligence
**Website**: ✅ Accurately describes multi-agent coordination, research agents, validation engineers, performance analysts  
**Docs**: ✅ Matches SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md description  
**Status**: **ALIGNED**

### ✅ Expository Intelligence  
**Website**: ✅ Accurately describes explainability levels (0-5), async processing, 22-26% performance boost  
**Docs**: ✅ Matches documentation  
**Status**: **ALIGNED**

### ⚠️ Autodidactic Intelligence
**Website**: ✅ Describes self-improvement, cross-problem learning, pattern recognition  
**Docs**: ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Docs state "SelfImprovementSystem: Complete implementation exists (935 LOC) but **not integrated into MasterOptimizer**"  
**Status**: **NEEDS CLARIFICATION** - Website may be overstating current capabilities

### ✅ Domain Extension
**Website**: ✅ Describes 13+ business domains, automatic code generation, FastAPI deployment  
**Docs**: ⚠️ **DISCREPANCY**: Docs say "6 operational domains (financial, healthcare, supply_chain, ai_ml, marketing, media)" but mention 13+ total  
**Status**: **NEEDS CLARIFICATION** - Should distinguish between "operational" vs "available"

---

## 2. Advanced Capabilities - Missing or Underrepresented

**Website**: ⚠️ **NOT EXPLICITLY MENTIONED**  
**Docs**: ✅ Prominently featured in AEAO-001 patent: "Unified Strategy Registry" integrating CMA-ES, Optuna, Nevergrad, Ax  
**Recommendation**: Add section highlighting multi-library integration as competitive advantage

### ❌ Blind Discovery Module
**Website**: ❌ **NOT MENTIONED**  
**Docs**: ✅ Key innovation in AEAO-001: "Blind discovery module exploring unknown landscapes without prior knowledge"  
**Recommendation**: Add as unique capability

### ❌ Consensus Mechanisms
**Website**: ⚠️ Mentioned briefly in Agentic Intelligence description  
**Docs**: ✅ Detailed in patents: "Consensus voting mechanisms with configurable thresholds"  
**Recommendation**: Expand description of consensus-based decision making

### ❌ Strategy Registry
**Website**: ❌ **NOT MENTIONED**  
**Docs**: ✅ Core component  
**Recommendation**: Add section on strategy selection and registry
